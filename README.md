🌦️ Real-Time Weather Prediction System
🗂 Overview

A full-stack, real-time weather prediction and monitoring app that fetches live meteorological data, performs lightweight processing, and streams insights to the browser. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. Tested and documented using Postman.

The system aggregates data from public weather APIs (e.g., current conditions + short-range forecasts), enriches it with utility metrics (heat index, wind chill, AQI category mapping if available), and presents it in a clean, responsive dashboard.

Each query returns:

Current weather (temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, cloud cover)

Near-term forecast (3–24 hours)

Optional alerts (if supported by the provider)

Derived insights (comfort score, precipitation risk bands, UV exposure band)

🎯 Project Objective

Deliver an accurate, low-latency weather experience with:

Real-time updates via polling or WebSocket/SSE.

Actionable insights (e.g., “carry an umbrella” or “high UV risk at noon”).

Developer-friendly API for integration into other apps/dashboards.

Portable front end that can be embedded or white-labeled.

🔍 Key Features & Analytics
1) City & Geolocation Lookup

Search by city name or use browser geolocation.

Reverse-geocode support (lat/lon ➜ city, country).

Helpful for travelers and mobile use cases.

2) Live Conditions & Micro-Trends

Current temperature, “feels like,” humidity, wind, visibility, pressure.

Micro-trend chips (e.g., “Temp rising”, “Gusts expected”).

3) Short-Range Forecast

Hourly forecast (up to 24h) with precipitation probability bands.

Compact sparkline for temperature and wind.

4) Alerts, UV & AQI (If available)

Weather advisories show as colored banners.

UV exposure band and reminder (“Sunscreen recommended”).

AQI category mapping to plain-language health guidance.

5) Comfort & Risk Scores

Comfort Score (0–100) from temp, humidity, wind.

Precipitation Risk (None/Low/Med/High) for the next 6 hours.

6) Real-Time Updates

Flexible schedule: client polling every N seconds.

Fixed schedule: server-side caching with TTL to control API usage.

7) Postman-Ready API

Documented REST endpoints.

Example collections and sample responses for rapid testing.

⚙️ System Architecture

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)

Responsive dashboard, search bar, geolocation button.

Live tiles (temp, humidity, wind), forecast charts (vanilla canvas).

Toasts for alerts and network/retry states.

Backend (Node.js + Express)

/api/weather routes: current, forecast, combined.

Upstream weather API client with retry & backoff.

Caching layer (in-memory with TTL; easy to swap Redis).

Optional SSE/WebSocket endpoint for push updates.

Data Flow
Browser ➜ GET /api/weather?city=… ➜ Server fetches+normalizes ➜ Cache ➜ Response ➜ Frontend renders ➜ Optional periodic refresh/push.

🧪 API Endpoints (for Postman)
GET /api/health

Basic health check.
200 → { "status": "ok", "uptime": 123.45 }

GET /api/weather/current

Query params:

city (string, optional if lat/lon provided)

lat, lon (numbers, optional if city provided)

units = metric|imperial (default: metric)

Response (example)

{
  "location": { "name": "Pune", "country": "IN", "lat": 18.52, "lon": 73.86 },
  "current": {
    "temp": 28.1,
    "feels_like": 30.2,
    "humidity": 66,
    "pressure": 1008,
    "wind_speed": 3.4,
    "wind_gust": 6.2,
    "clouds": 75,
    "visibility": 8000,
    "uv": 7
  },
  "derived": {
    "comfort_score": 72,
    "precip_risk": "Low",
    "trend": "Temp rising"
  },
  "updated_at": "2025-08-27T17:30:00Z",
  "ttl": 120
}

GET /api/weather/forecast

Query params: city|lat/lon, hours (default: 12), units
Returns hourly bins with temp, precipitation probability, wind.

GET /api/weather/combined

Returns both current and forecast plus derived insights in one call.

GET /api/weather/alerts

Returns weather alerts if the upstream provider supports it.

Import the Postman Collection (JSON) and Environment (with your API key) to test all endpoints quickly.

🧩 How It Works (End-to-End)

User Input: The user types a city or allows geolocation.

API Request: Frontend calls /api/weather/combined?city=Pune.

Server Logic:

Checks cache; if stale, calls upstream weather API.

Normalizes fields (units, naming) and computes derived metrics.

Stores response with a TTL (e.g., 120s) to respect rate limits.

Frontend Render:

Updates current tiles and forecast chart.

Shows alerts/UV/AQI chips if present.

Schedules next refresh or listens to SSE/WebSocket events.

Resilience: Retries with exponential backoff; graceful fallbacks if partial data is missing.

🧠 Derived Metrics (DAX-like logic, implemented in JS)

Comfort Score (0–100): Weighted blend of normalized temp, humidity, and wind.

Precipitation Risk: Map of pop (probability of precipitation) to bands:

0–10%: None, 10–30%: Low, 30–60%: Medium, >60%: High

UV Band: 0–2 Low, 3–5 Moderate, 6–7 High, 8–10 Very High, 11+ Extreme

Trend Detection: Compare latest 2–3 readings to label “rising”, “steady”, “falling”.

🛠 Tools & Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Flex/Grid), vanilla JavaScript (Fetch API, Canvas).

Backend: Node.js, Express, node-fetch/axios, dotenv, optional ws or SSE.

Testing & Docs: Postman (collections, environments).

Data Sources: Public weather APIs (plug your provider + key).

Optional: Redis (caching), PM2 (process manager), Nginx (reverse proxy).

🚀 Getting Started
1) Clone & Install
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd realtime-weather
npm install

2) Configure Environment

Create .env:

PORT=8080
API_BASE_URL=https://<your-weather-api-base>
WEATHER_API_KEY=<your-key>
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=120
DEFAULT_UNITS=metric
ALLOW_GEO=true

3) Run the Server
npm run dev
# or
node server.js

4) Open the App

Visit http://localhost:8080 and search for a city, or click “Use My Location”.

🧪 Using Postman

Import postman/WeatherAPI.postman_collection.json.

Import postman/WeatherEnv.postman_environment.json.

Set WEATHER_API_KEY and API_BASE_URL in the environment.

Hit:

GET {{baseUrl}}/api/health

GET {{baseUrl}}/api/weather/current?city=Pune

GET {{baseUrl}}/api/weather/combined?lat=18.52&lon=73.86&units=metric

🔐 Security & Limits

Rate limiting middleware to protect upstream quotas.

Input validation (city names, lat/lon ranges).

HTTPS recommended in production; hide keys via server-side calls.

CORS configured for your front-end origin(s).

📈 Outcomes

Fast, reliable weather experience with actionable insights.

Reusable API for other products (mobile apps, kiosks, dashboards).

Scalable with caching and optional streaming updates.

Clear Postman docs for quick QA and integration.

📎 Conclusion

This Real-Time Weather Prediction System blends clean UI with robust Node.js APIs to deliver live conditions, short-term forecasts, and human-friendly guidance. It’s developer-ready, easy to deploy, and built for real users—whether they’re planning a commute or scheduling an outdoor event.
